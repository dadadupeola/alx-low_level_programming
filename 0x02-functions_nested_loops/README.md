# Functions, nested loops

This project is for the **Full STack Software Engineering** **AlX Software Engineerng Program**. This project teaches about header files, loops, functions and nested loops in **C Language**

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using gcc 4.8.4
* C files rae written according to standards, that is the C90 standard
* The programs is teasted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
